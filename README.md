# turtlesimAutomata
This custom C++ node for ROS 2 will spawn a simulated turtlebot in the center of the screen with a random orientation. It will then drive forward until an edge is detected where it will turn 90 degrees, print “Edge Detected” to the terminal and continue driving. A custom Bash script can install the package.

Please do not run the bash script with sudo. It will not work and sudo should not be needed
